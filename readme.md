# CBT Habit Loop Server

A GrahpQL server that will handle routing and database persistence.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node.js (version 8 or newer) installed on your computer:
https://nodejs.org/en/

Install modules

```
npm install
```

You will also need to install serverless or run serverless in the node_modules bin.
I suggest installing serverless globally with:

```
npm install -g serverless
```

If running with a local dynamodb you can use docker to start up an instance:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local
```

Otherwise running dynamodb will require Java.

#### Redis

This service also uses redis which will need to be setup as well.

Redis Labs is a good free way to get a redis instance up and running. Just sign up [here](https://redislabs.com/) and they'll walk you through the process pretty easily. What you'll need is the host and password. Those can be set in the environment whenever it should be deployed or started locally.

#### AWS Credentials

To deploy the server in AWS and receive a url that anyone can access, you'll need aws credentials from IAM.

Create an AWS account if you do not have one and go to the IAM dashboard. From there go to the access keys tab and hit `Create New Access Key`.

Save the file containing the keys if you want and then configure them with [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/config-credentials/)

More explicit documentation on configuring secrets with AWS described in the [serverless docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/).

Remember to NEVER COMMIT THEM TO THE REPO.

## Deploying

To deploy to your AWS account all you have to do is run:

```
NODE_ENV=qa serverless deploy
```

Make sure the AWS credentials are set up properly if you get errors.

A common error I've run into is that deploying on macOS fails while deploying on a windows machine works. There's some weird stuff going on with bcrypt binaries or something but just mentioning it here in case the deploy doesn't work. [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15809611/bcrypt-invalid-elf-header-when-running-node-app).

## Running Locally

Once you clone this git repository, navigate to the containing folder and run

```
NODE_ENV=dev serverless offline start
```

You can then visit the graphql playground at localhost:3000/playground

## Testing

To test the server run the following command:

```
npm test
```

The http file in `src/test` uses the rest client in vscode available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

The extension now supports graphQL queries so it's really easy to test if the lambda is running in AWS and to get some quick debugging done.

## Debugging

Sometimes the logs are responses are not very clear when hitting the endpoints from the app or manually. You can pass a graphQL query directly into the lambda through AWS.
